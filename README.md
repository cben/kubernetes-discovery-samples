# What?

Outputs of GET on simple paths like `/api` and `/apis/batch/v1`, collected on various versions of kubernetes.

# Why?

To help answer questions like "can I assume `verbs` was always there? When was it added?"

# How?

See [tools/](tools/) directory.
I'm starting from openshift, not kubernetes
